    <h3 class="header3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="u-list">
        <li>2 ¾ pounds Idaho® Russet Potatoes</li>
        <li>8 large hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup dill pickles, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup Miracle Whip</li>
        <li>½ cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brine from a pickle jar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header3">Directions</h3>
    <ol class="o-list">
        <li>step 1</li>
        <p>Scrub Idaho® Russet Potatoes well, but do not peel. Place potatoes in a stockpot, 
            add water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high 
            and cook 12 to 15 minutes, or until a knife can easily pierce the potatoes but they 
            are still firm. Pour off the hot water and add cold water to the pot to help cool 
            down the potatoes. Set potatoes aside while preparing the remaining ingredients.
        </p>
        
        <li>step 2</li>
        <p>Remove the yolks from 4 of the hard-boiled eggs. Discard or save for another use. 
            Roughly chop the 4 egg whites and 2 of the whole eggs, saving 2 for garnish. Add the 
            chopped eggs to a large mixing bowl. Add the onion and chopped pickles to the bowl.
        </p>
        
        <li>step 3</li>
        <p>In a small mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Miracle Whip, Greek yogurt, 
            dill pickle brine, yellow mustard, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk well to combine; 
            set aside.
        </p>
        
        <li>step 4</li>
        <p>Remove the cooled potatoes from the pot of water. With a paring knife, remove the 
            potato peels (they will come off easily). Cut the potatoes into small cubes and add 
            to the other ingredients in the mixing bowl. With a wooden spoon, gently toss the 
            salad ingredients to mix. Add the dressing mixture and gently toss again to coat all 
            ingredients well.
        </p>

        <li>step 5</li>
        <p>Transfer potato salad to a serving bowl. Cut the remaining 2 eggs into thin slices and 
            arrange them around the salad to garnish. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours before 
            serving (preferably overnight) to let the flavors combine.
