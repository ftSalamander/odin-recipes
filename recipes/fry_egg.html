    <p>There are few things more beautiful in this world than a perfectly cooked fried egg.
        They can upgrade pretty much anything, from an avocado toast to a double cheeseburger and beyond.
        Follow these simple tips and you'll be slingin' eggs like your favorite diner in no time.

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter, or fat of your choice</li>
        <li>large egg</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Choose the right pan.</li>
        <p>When it comes to pretty much anything else, I'm all about a cast iron skillet. 
            For eggs though, nothing works better than nonstick. I basically bought a nonstick pan 
            just for cooking eggs, and it's worth it. Nonstick skillets typically have a shorter lifespan, 
            so don't feel bad about buying one on the cheaper side—<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000658GT6/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ogi&tag=delish_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=[artid|1782.r.23499380[src|[ch|[lt|">
            this one</a> is my favorite . If you're like 
            me and usually make 1 to 2 fried eggs at a time, an 8" pan is perfect. If you cook up breakfast 
            for a crowd on the regular, go for something bigger.
        </p>
        <p>If you don't have a nonstick pan, you can use a cast iron or carbon steel pan in a pinch. Just make sure 
            to up the amount of fat to avoid scraping burnt bits of egg off your pan.
        </p>
        
        <li>Choose the right fat.</li>
        <p>Butter is the most classic choice for frying eggs, and in my opinion the best. Why? 
            It's just... so, so, good. BUT! If butter isn't your thing, there are plenty of other options. 
            Olive oil is a great choice as well, it'll still add some flavor and will give your eggs some 
            deliciously golden crunchy edges. Vegetable oil works fine if it's all you've got, but it's not 
            preferred. If have some bacon fat (the holiest of fats) on the other hand, you're in business. 
            Name me a more iconic duo than bacon and eggs. I'll wait.

        <li>Cook 'em your way.</li>
        <p>Everyone likes their eggs differently, and that's ok! I, along with many others, prefer my yolks 
            runny—which is why I usually go the sunny-side-up or over-easy route. In both, the whites are set 
            and the yolks are runny. The difference is that over-easy eggs are flipped before removing from the 
            pan, while sunny-side-up eggs only cook on one side. Eggs over-medium and over-hard just require 
            longer cook time on their flipped side so the yolk is semi or completely cooked, respectively.
