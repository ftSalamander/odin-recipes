# odin-recipes
***
This my first HTML project. This porject is the result of my web development learning journey with [The odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). All the knowledge that I have learned with them about HTML is reflected here in this project.
## Things that I have learned from this project.
- I applied various html tags that I have learned so far in a project. 
- Now I have got a better understanding of basic file structure in an HTML project. And how to navigate those directorys and files.

_I will also going to use CSS in this project, when I am going to learn them. so this is not the end of this porject. I will work more on this later_
